# NFL-data
Exploratory analysis of NFL data.

## Steps to run

### 1. Download Python 3.9.12

### 2. Open the repo folder in VSCode.

### 3. Open a new terminal in VSCode.

### 4. Activate the virtual environment.

Run `pipenv sync --dev` if using repo for the first time. If a returning user, run `pipenv shell`.

### 5. (For now) Run the only script.

Run `python download_data.py`. This will provide output for the 2024 NFL season. (Season can be adjusted in the `download_data.py` script.)

### 6. (For now) Take a look at the only output.

Output has been stored in the "data" subdirectory.
